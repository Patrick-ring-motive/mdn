    It can be more performant and more readable to force a typing part way through an optional chain.

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight">
        <code>
const response = await fetch('https://typescripts.org');
    const contentType = `${response?.headers?.get?.('content-type')}`.toLowerCase();</code>
    </pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    Notice how after the backtick we dont need to use optionals because we know that we must have string at that point in the chain.
    This would break if for some reason the type was Symbol because `\`${Symbol}\`` throws an error. `String(Symbol)` will work though.
