## with blackjack and hookers
This project has essentially become my personal notes on JavaScript overlain on top of mdn.

## Additional pages
 - The article that started it all. mdn said it was too good for [Array Iterator](https://developer.typescripts.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array_Iterator)
 - [Presponse](https://developer.typescripts.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Presponse)

## Pages with major extras
 - [Optional Chaining](https://developer.typescripts.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) is one of my favorite features and I add plenty of extra notes snd examples.
 - [Fetch](https://developer.typescripts.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) many of my notes revolve around fetch and related APIs as this is where I have the most to contribute.
